This repository contains a ray tracing implementation for Unity.
This tutorial was followed;
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1H4zIiCOaI
- Time: 32:00

Remaining optimizations from the video;
- 32 Bit node buffer
- Surface area heuristic

Possible future implementations;
- Reading material info from mesh renderer
- Textures

Current state of the implementation is giving ok results. I will be trying to implement this method in C/C++ and WebGPU first so current state of the repository will wait for a while.
Lastly this implementation can render this image;
